Somewhere on the devprep machine, a TCP port is open, soliciting a service to
be communicated with.  Find the open port, reverse engineer the service, and
build a rudimentary client (level of detail is up to you.  Hell, implementation
language is up to you.)

Name your project uct on github.  Your client should be called uct.

The port may not be open from the outside world; you may need to be on the
devprep machine to access it.
